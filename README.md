This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where the server crashes when a request body is missing required fields. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution with proper error handling.  The issue arises from accessing properties of `req.body` without checking for their existence.  The solution implements input validation to prevent crashes and provides meaningful error messages to clients.
